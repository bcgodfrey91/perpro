# Serverless

The Serverless Framework is an open-source framework made with Node.js, with the intent to be used alongside "function as a service" technologies. These technologies include AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, and many others. According to their site:
```
Serverless abstracts away the most menial parts of building an
application, leaving developers free to actually spend their
days coding. What this means is that developers can
single-handedly build apps that handle production-ready
traffic. They donâ€™t have to actively manage scaling for their
applications. They don't have to provision servers, or pay
for resources that go unused. They can just get projects
off the ground with small, agile teams.
```

With the ability to not have to worry about scaling, Serverless provides a great option for those that are wanting to create small-scale side project that they think could turn into something big.

For those looking to get their feet wet, the [Anomaly Innovations](https://anoma.ly/) team provides [an extremely thorough tutorial](https://serverless-stack.com/) on how to build a Serverless backend with a React front end.
