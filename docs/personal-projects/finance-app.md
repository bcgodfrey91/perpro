# Finance App

Building a finance app provides several interesting challenges in a personal project. For this application, you should take the dive into React Native. In addition, the app should display a list of investments, allow the user to route to a page for each, individual investment, and display a visualization for the performance of the selected investment.

Here are some free, investment APIs for you to work with:
- Stock Market API: https://iextrading.com/developer/
- Crypto Currency API: https://coinmarketcap.com/api/

Learning opportunities:
- Building a native application
- Accessing data from an API
- Native routing

Take it to the next level:
- Connect the application to your database choice
- Add user accounts
- Allow users to save their favorite investment options
- Allow users to access information on both stock and crypto investment options
- Add real-time data visualization using D3 and websockets
