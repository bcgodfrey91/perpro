# Kanban Board

It seems that almost every job posting these days asks for prospective employees to be familiar with Agile methodologies, and Kanban boards serve as an integral part for a number of teams that operate under this umbrella. For this project, start off with four columns that consist of "Backlog", "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". Let each of these columns have rows of priority spanning from "Low", to "Medium", and to "High". Allow a user to create an issue, give it a title and description, and assign it a priority. Any recently created issue should go directly into the "Backlog" column. Lastly, allow the user to drag and drop the issue into each column based on where the item is at in the process.

**Learning opportunities:**
- Building a CRUD application
- Drag and drop API

**Take it to the next level:**
- Connect the application to a database of your choice
- Add user accounts
  - These two could also be subsituted by putting the items in local storage
- Allow users to add and delete columns
- Allow users to add and delete levels of priority
- Allow users to change the priority of an issue even after it is assigned
- Add a search capability.
- Save any changes for the user to see the next time they visit their board
