# Portfolio

This should go without saying, but a portfolio is a great way to show off your skills and the personal projects you've worked on outside of the office. If you haven't build one for yourself yet, there is no better time to do so than now! There's a lot of different advice that gets thrown around when it comes to creating a portfolio:

- Find another portfolio you like and copy it
- Find different elements of sites you like and piece them together
- Copy templates you like from sites like SquareSpace or WordPress
- Go crazy and build whatever you want

There's no right answer about how to build a portfolio, therefore, there's no set instructions for this project. Take your time with planning, outline what you want to create and the story you want to tell about yourself, build yourself a site that shows off all of your development chops, and then deploy it for the world to see!

**Learning opportunities:**
- Building a responsive website
- Deploying a project
