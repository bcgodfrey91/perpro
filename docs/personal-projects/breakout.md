# Breakout

This may be an example you've seen before, as it's a pretty classic project from MDN. That being said, there are a lot of lessons one can learn from creating a game in pure Javascript. For this app, you should use vanilla Javascript to create the game of Breakout. In addition, you will also want to use HTML5 canvas in order to build your game.

**Learning opportunities:**
- Vanilla Javascript
- Canvas

**Take it to the next level:**
- Add powerups
- Add different styles of tiles
  - For example, some tiles might take two hits to break instead of one
