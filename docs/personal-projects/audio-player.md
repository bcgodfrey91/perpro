# Audio Player

Electron applications are a great way to build desktop applications with web technologies. For this project, you should pick a framework of your choosing to pair with Electron in order to build a desktop audio player. It should be able to access the file system in order to upload new songs, save the songs to the user's localstorage, as well as provided the expected functionality of a standard, music player.

**Learning opportunities:**
- Building a desktop application
- Pulling in data from a user's file system
- Setting and getting data from localstorage

**Take it to the next level:**
- Allow a user to drag and drop a file into the application, instead of only being able to upload a song directly from their files.
- Display a sidebar all the artists the user has uploaded
  - Take this another step further and create subgroups for albums by the artist
- Allow users to create playlists
- Implement various sorting capabilities
