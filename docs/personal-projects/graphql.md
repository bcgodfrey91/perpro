# GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language that's making developers rethink the way they send and receive data. Facebook open-sourced GraphQL in 2015 with the goal of providing an alternative to traditional REST API architecture. The community is steadily growing, so now is a great time to dive in and see what it's all about. For this project, make a notes app using Node, Hapi, MongoDB, and GraphQL. [Indrek Lasn](https://twitter.com/lasnindrek) outlines how to get your server set up in [this medium post](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-setup-a-powerful-api-with-nodejs-graphql-mongodb-hapi-and-swagger-e251ac189649), but you will need to set up the front end on your own! Pick any language/framework you'd like.

**Learning opportunities:**
- GraphQL
- Hapi
- MongoDB
- Building a front and backend that work together

**Take it to the next level:**
- This is a pretty intensive CRUD app, so let's skip the extra features for now ðŸ˜‰
