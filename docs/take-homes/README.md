# Overview

Although every company will have a different preference when it comes to coding challenges and technical assessments, the "take home" is still a fairly popular option. For these types of challenges, you will be given some type of objective that you need to complete within a given timeframe. Some companies will provide you with comps you need to rebuild, some will ask you to add new features to an existing app, and some will simply give you a link to an API and tell you to "make something dope." Regardless of what is asked of you, there are a few considerations you should make when completing a code challenge:

**1. Quality:**
- Can parts of the app be built so that the code could be easily reused?
- Would another developer be able to easily parachute into your code and make updates?
- Are there parts of the code that should be documented?
- Can you speak to why you made the decisions you did for your app?

**2. Design:**
- The end user experience is always of the utmost importance. Even if you don't complete the challenge, ensure your code is as intuitive and bug-free as possible.
- Could you get fancy and add any transitions or animations that will enhance the overall feel of the app?
- Does your app look right and function properly on mobile, tablet, and desktop views?

Most of the following challenges fail to give a timeframe for you to work under, but you should try to timebox yourself for any of them that you decide to try.
