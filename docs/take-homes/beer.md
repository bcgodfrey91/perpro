# Beer Ratings

A number of take home challenges want to see you demonstrate skills you'd be using daily as a front end developer. These include, but are not limited to, hitting an API, rendering the results, managing state, routing to new pages, etc. Keeping that in mind, for this app you will be building a Beer Ratings app while attempting to do the folowing:
- Hit the [punk API](https://punkapi.com/) in order to get a list of beers
- Render the results in a column on mobile view, and in rows of three on desktop
  - Each element should contain an image, name, and description of the beer
- Allow users to "favorite" an item and maintain a list of favorites
- Allow users to search through the list of beers
- Create separate routes (using [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)) for both the favorites list and the individual beers

While credit for this specific example goes out to [Garrett Levine](https://medium.com/@GarrettLevine/5-projects-to-complete-when-starting-to-learn-front-end-web-development-48e8a1ce3178), there are many different variations of this challenge that you might see as a take home challenge.
