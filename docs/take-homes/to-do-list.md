# To Do List

A true classic, for this code challenge you should create a to do list by using the framework of your choice. With this app, the user should be able to create a new to do item, mark it as done, and filter out issue (all, in progress, completed). To make things a little more challenging (and fun), use the [drag and drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) to allow the user to drag and drop the most important items to the top of the list.
