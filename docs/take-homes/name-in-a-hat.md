# Name in a Hat

For the Name in a Hat challenge, you should create a basic UI that allows names to be added into an imaginary hat. Users shold then be allowed to randomly pick a name. This should be done using vanilla Javascript, but feel free to make the design as simple or as creative as you'd like. Some things to keep in mind while creating this app:
- After the user types a name, they should be able to hit enter OR click a "Submit" button to add it to an array called `names`
- A name should be a basic string
- If a name already exists in the array, it cannot be added again
- There should be a "Draw a Name" button that picks a name from the hat
- When a name is drawn, remove it from the `names` array so that it cannot be drawn again
- The name picked should be displayed to the user and then disappear after 5 seconds
