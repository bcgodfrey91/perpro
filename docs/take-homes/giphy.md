# Giphy Challenge

Occasionally you’ll get a front end coding challenge that isn’t so much about your JavaScript know-how, but is, instead, about your design abilities and creativity. For this challenge, consume the Giphy API to create an engaging and unique experience. Be as creative as you’d like in order to show your personality through the app.

There are very few “explicit” requirements for this challenge. This is your chance to explore. All that is asked from you is the following:
1. Use git for version control and push your code to github
2. Use any frameworks or tools (SaSS, LESS, etc.) that you think are appropriate
3. Be sure that your app is responsive
