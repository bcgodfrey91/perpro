# Calendar

Using the front end framework of your choice, create a monthly calendar UI like the image below. To keep this simple, make it so that the calendar only aligns with the _current_ month, and don't worry about making it reflect the entire year.

In addition to the UI, you will need to add the ability to create and delete events. The input for the event should pop up as a modal, and should have an input for the event title, description, date, and time. These items should be stored in the user's local storage so that they do not disappear upon refreshing the app.
