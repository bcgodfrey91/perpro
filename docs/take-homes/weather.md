# Weather Display

Much like the beer list challenge, this take home project is going to ask you to some things you would do in your day to day job as a developer. For this challenge, you should allow users to type a location into a search bar, use that query to hit the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev), and render a unique display based on the returned weather conditions.
